  description: `**Purpose:** Create a broadcast campaign (one email sent to an entire segment). Defines subject, body, and segment; does NOT send yet. Use send-broadcast to send it.

**NOT for:** Sending a one-off email to specific people (use send-email). Not for adding contacts (use create-contact).

**Returns:** Broadcast ID. Use this ID with send-broadcast to send, or get-broadcast/update-broadcast to manage.

**When to use:**
- User wants to "email my list", "send a newsletter", "broadcast to my segment", "email all contacts in X"
- Newsletter, announcement, or bulk message to one segment
- Supports personalization: {{{FIRST_NAME}}}, {{{LAST_NAME}}}, {{{EMAIL}}}, {{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}

**"All contacts" note:** Broadcasts require a segment. There is no "all contacts" option in the API. If the user wants to send to all contacts, check list-segments for an existing segment that covers everyone. If none exists, suggest creating one with create-segment.

**Workflow:** list-segments (if needed) → create-broadcast → get-tiptap-json-content (with include_schema: true) → compose-broadcast → send-broadcast.

**Content options after creating:**
- **compose-broadcast** (recommended): Sets TipTap content that the user can visually edit in the Resend dashboard. Use this when the user wants to collaborate on or refine the email in the editor.
- **update-broadcast with html/text**: Sets static HTML/text content. Use this only when the user explicitly wants to set raw HTML. Switching between compose and html/text modes is lossy — some content or formatting may be lost. Ask the user before switching.`,
